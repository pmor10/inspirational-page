        <h2>About Oprah</h2>
        <p>
          Oprah Winfrey has had the kind of career that was once seen as an
          impossibility for a woman. The accomplished actress and media mogul
          has defied many odds and smashed through barriers to get where she is
          today. What you may not have known is that Oprah has been battling
          against adversity her whole life. Oprah Gail Winfrey was born on
          January 29, 1954, in Kosciusko, Mississippi to young parents. Her
          mother, Vernita Lee, was 18 and her father, Vernon Winfrey, was 20 per
          The Sun and Live About.

          Oprah's parents weren't together, leaving her to be raised by her
          grandmother, Hattie Mae Lee, while her mom moved north to find a home
          and secure work. The early years of Oprah's life were filled with
          learning. Hattie Mae taught Oprah how to read and brought her to
          church, where the little girl would read passages aloud. She started
          kindergarten at five, but quickly was moved to the first grade when
          they saw how well she read and wrote per Notable Biographies.

        <p>
          Oprah Winfrey has the ultimate rags-to-riches story, and it is so
          inspiring to think of where she came from. Orpah Gail Winfrey (no,
          that isn't a typo) was born on January 29, 1954. Her aunt wanted her
          named for Orpah in the biblical book of Ruth, so that's how it's
          spelled on her birth certificate. But people weren't sure how to
          pronounce it, so her name became Oprah. Winfrey's young mother was
          unwed and poor, so she sent Winfrey to live with her grandmother until
          she was 6 years old.

          Even though Winfrey was surrounded by love as a young child, they
          didn't have much else. Her grandmother worked as a maid and told
          Winfrey that she would also grow up to be a maid too. According to a
          profile by The Observer (via The Guardian), during this time, she wore
          clothes made from potato sacks, which resulted in people cruelly
          calling her "Sack Girl." But even as a young child, Winfrey knew she
          was meant for much greater things.
